SCHOLARLY OVERVIEW\nInfluenza vaccines, colloquially known as flu shots or flu jab, are vaccines that protect against infection by influenza viruses. New versions of the vaccines are developed twice a year, as the influenza virus rapidly changes. While their effectiveness varies from year to year, most provide modest to high protection against influenza. Vaccination against influenza began in the 1930s, with large-scale availability in the United States beginning in 1945.\nBoth the World Health Organization and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend yearly vaccination for nearly all peop...\n\n### II.
